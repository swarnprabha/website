**_E-Commerce Website_**

» As a project, I made this e-commerce website incorporates essential features that are fundamental to any online retail platform, providing a practical application of web 
  development concepts. It serves as a demonstration of building a user-centered design and highlights the importance of creating a responsive, accessible, and engaging web
  application. The website showcases a diverse range of products, each presented with detailed descriptions, high-quality images, and user reviews. The intuitive navigation 
  ensures that users can effortlessly browse through product categories, perform searches, and filter results to find exactly what they are looking for. The shopping cart 
  functionality allows users to add, update, or remove items, while the secure and efficient checkout process ensures a smooth transaction experience.
